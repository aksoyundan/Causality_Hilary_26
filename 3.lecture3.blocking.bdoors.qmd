## Blocking backdoor paths via selection on observables

Most popular identification strategy: selection on observables, also known as conditional ignorability/independence (stats), unconfoundedness (econ), or conditional exchangeability (epi)

* What is an observational study? 

* What is an omitted variable bias?

* What assumptions are required for identification?

* Common estimation methods: 

  1. Regression 

  2. Matching

  3. Weighting
  
  4. Augmented and doubly robust estimators

# Observational studies {background-color="#00a191"}

## What is an observational study?

We already discussed the importance of [**random assignment**]{style="color:green"} to justify drawing causal conclusions and conduct statistical inference

. . .

Observational data is generated when the treatment of interest is [**not**]{style="color:red"} in control of the researcher (e.g., survey data, administrative records, etc.)

. . .

An observational study is an attempt to use observational data to [*approximate*]{style="color:blue"} causal conclusions (or, as some would say, "to approximate an experiment")

. . .

While, in experiments, (conditional) ignorability is justified by design, in observational studies it relies on [untestable and extra-statistical]{.fragment .fade-in .highlight-red} assumptions


## Credible observational studies

Not all comparisons are created equal!

. . .

It is all too common to run some regression analysis and analyse its output as-if a credible *causal* ("controlled") comparison can be immediately obtained from the data

. . .

Most times, just recognizing that "our results are not causal" is not enough to prevent a causal interpretation!

. . .

[A credible observational study should be carefully designed to address common issues and rule out alternative explanations]{style="color:green"}

## Credible observational studies

<br>

* Assignment is not random, but is it well understood?

* Can we explain why some units that look similar receive different treatments?

* Do we have reliable measures of our variables of interest? 

* Does the timing of measurement allow us to order them?

* Can we check "balance" in observable characteristics?

* Can we quantify the influence that unobserved confounding would have on our results?

* Can we rule out alternative explanations to the observed "treatment effect"?

## What to do? {background-color="#00a191"}

## 

![](img/ovb_authors.jpg){.center}


# Unconfoundedness {background-color="#00a191"}

## General setting

Let's assume the following:

* We observe units $i = 1, \dots, n$
* We observe a treatment $D \in {0,1}$
* We assume potential outcomes $Y_{di}$ are well defined

. . . 

Our quantity of interest can be (most commonly) the ATE or the ATT

. . . 

We have a collection of $k$ [**pre-treatment**]{style="color:blue"} covariates: $X_i = [X_{i1}, \dots , X_{ik}]$

* Predetermined / causally precede $D_i$
* If $X_i$ causes both $D$ and $Y$, it would [*confound*]{style="color:red"} the relationship between them
* If $X_i$ is potentially affected by $D_i$, then it may possibly be a [*mediator*]{style="color:red"}, and it should be handlded with double care

More formally: $X$ is a valid adjustment set according to the backdoor criterion

## Assumptions

The main assumption in this context is usually referred as unconfoudedness, conditional ignorability, or conditional exhangeability (i.e. backdoor criterion is satisfied by X)

It can be formalized as:

$$
\{Y^T_{i}, Y^C_{i}\} \indep D_i | X_i
$$

:::{.callout-note}
## Read it like this
Among units with the same values of $X$, the treatment $D_i$ is as-good-as randomly assigned
:::

. . .

To actually be able to condition by $X$, we also require positivity (or overlap): the treatment is not deterministic at any relevant value of $X=x$

$$
0 < P(D_i = 1 | X_i) < 1
$$

## Identification of ATE/ATT

**Intuition**: Within strata of X, we have an experiment

**Proof**: Let's start with the strata effects $\tau(x)$

$$
\tau(x) = E[Y^T_{i} - Y^C_{i}|X=x] = E[Y^T_{i}|X=x] - E[Y^C_{i}|X=x]  
$$
$$
= E[Y^T_{i}|X=x, D_i=1] - E[Y^C_{i}|X=x, D_i=0] 
$$

$$
= E[Y_{i}|X=x, D_i=1] - E[Y_{i}|X=x, D_i=0]
$$
Then, using the **positivity** or overlap assumption:

$$
ATE = E_x[\tau(x)] = E_x(E[Y^T_{i} - Y^C_{i}|X=x] )
$$

$$
= \sum_x \tau(x) p(x)
$$

## In a DAG framework


```{r, message=FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=2}
plot(dagitty::dagitty('dag{ 
  Abunchofvariables [pos="1,-1"] 
  D [pos="0,0"] 
  Y [pos="2,0"] 
  D -> Y ; Abunchofvariables -> {D Y} }'))
```

$$E[Y \mid Do(D=1), Abunchofvariables] - E[Y \mid Do(D=0), Abunchofvariables]$$

is identified under the assumptions

[*Note:*]{style="color:red"} As we will see shortly, regression blocks the
path $\rightarrow Y$ while matching and weighthing blocks the path $\rightarrow D$.
Blocking any of these paths will identify the "causal" effect of D on Y.

# Estimation {background-color="#00a191"}

## Estimation overview

Under our non-parametric assumptions, the ATE/ATT is identified by the adjustment formula

In practice, different estimators can be used, each incorporate further assumptions 

The most widely used estimators are

- Regression
- Matching
- Weighting
- Augmented estimators

::: callout-note
NOTE: none of these estimators are identification strategies.
Never say "my results are causal, because I used {matching| weighting | a fancy new estimator of selection on observables}. You buy causality through model assumptions, make those assumptions credible and transparent."
:::

We will use them in the hands-on exercises of this week

# Modeling the outcome: Regression {background-color="#E9004C"}

## Regression: look at *the* coefficient!

In regression we take a model-based approach

For simplicity, let's assume that the potential outcomes follow certain functional form:

$$
E[Y^D_i|D_i,X_i] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + \gamma^{\top}X_i
$$

Which means that 

$E[Y^C|X] = E[Y|D=0,X] = \mu_0 = \beta_0 + \gamma^{\top}X_i$ 

$E[Y^T|X] = E[Y|D=1,X] = \mu_1 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \gamma^{\top}X_i$

so $\beta_1 = E[Y^T|X] - E[Y^C|X]  = ATE$

[Side note]{style="color:red;"}: subscripts in regression describe what a variable or coefficient 
varies along, e.g. 

$$
Y_{it} = \beta_g + \beta_t + \beta_1 D_{it} + \beta_2 W_i + \epsilon_{it}
$$
so intercepts vary by some group (g) and time (t), while D varies by individuals
and time W varies only by individuals but is time-constant.

. . .

What are we assuming about the treatment effect? What are we assuming about the potential outcomes? Are those assumptions sensible?

## *The* coefficient is a conditional variance weighted ATE under effect heterogeneity

| S | P(S, D = 0) | E(Y \| S, D = 0) | P(S, D = 1) | E(Y  \| S, D = 1) |
|---|-------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | 0.36        | 4                | 0.08        | 0                |
| 2 | 0.12        | 6                | 0.12        | 10                |
| 3 | 0.12        | 10               | 0.20        | 12               |

True ATE: $-4\times(0.36+0.08) + 4\times(0.12+0.12) + 2\times(0.12+0.20) = -.16$

. . . 

When lm(Y ~ D + as.factor(S)) $\rightarrow \beta_D \approx  0.62^{*}$!! why?

. . .

<font size="6">
$\beta_D$ = $\Delta E[Y|S=1] \frac{var[D|S=1]P[S=1]}{\sum var[D|S=s]P[S=s]} +
\Delta E[Y|S=2] \frac{var[D|S=2]P[S=2]}{\sum var[D|S=s]P[S=s]} +
\Delta E[Y|S=3] \frac{var[D|S=3]P[S=3]}{\sum var[D|S=s]P[S=s]}$
</font>

. . . 

$var[D|S=1] = (\frac{.08}{.08+.36})(1-\frac{.08}{.08+.36})= .15$, $P[S=1] = .08+.36 = .44$
$var[D|S=2] = (\frac{.12}{.12+.12})(1-\frac{.12}{.12+.12})= .25$, $P[S=2] = .12+.12 = .24$
$var[D|S=3] = (\frac{.20}{.20+.12})(1-\frac{.20}{.20+.12})= .23$, $P[S=3] = .12+.20 = .32$

. . . 

$\beta_D = {\bf -4} \frac{.15 \times .44}{.15 \times .44 + .25 \times .24 + .23 \times .32}
          + {\bf 4} \frac{.25 \times .24}{.15 \times .44 + .25 \times .24 + .23 \times .32} 
          + {\bf 2} \frac{.23 \times .32}{.15 \times .44 + .25 \times .24 + .23 \times .32} = 0.62$

## Beware that $\beta$ may not always represent ATE even if causal assumptions are valid

* When there is heterogeneity in causal effect, beware that $\beta$ is weighted by the conditional variance of treatment

* Those with a lot of variance in treatment represented more strongly in $\beta$

    * E.g. in DID groups which received treatment in the middle of the timeframe rather than start or end
    * This "rediscovery" of variance weighting sparked the new dynamic DID literature
    * With continuous and many controls weights going in $\beta$ are even more complex
    
* You *could* recover true ATE by, e.g., lm(Y ~ D*as.factor(S)) in the example before

    * But when you have too many controls or more than one effect of interest, should you take all interactions?


## Regression: pros and cons

Pros: 

* Everybody loves a regression!

* Easy to interpret

* (Often) transparent

* Flexible (interactions etc. can be added easily)

* Uses variation efficiently

Cons:

* Restrictive functional form

* Incorrect modeling decisions can ruin the results

* Simplicity can be elusive, sometimes regression can give non-transparent
results (e.g. TWFE in diff-in-diff--later...)

* $\beta$ is often some strange variance weighted ATE

* We lose interesting variation

* Extrapolation, possibility of non-overlap

## Regression extensions: penalised regression
Regression (OLS in particular) finds $\beta$s in a way that 
minimises sum of squares between predicted and observed variables, that is: 

$$argmin_\beta \{ \sum(Y - \hat{Y})^2\}$$

Penalised regressions minimise the same thing *plus* a function of $\beta$s:

$$argmin_\beta \{ \sum(Y - \hat{Y})^2 + \lambda F(\beta) \}$$

| Model | $F()$ | $\lambda$ |
|---------|------|----------|
| OLS   | NA                       | 0 |
| LASSO | $\sum|\beta|$ (L1-norm)  | estimate w cross-validation |
| Ridge | $\sum \beta^2$ (L2-norm) | estimate w cross-validation |

LASSO/Ridge is for prediction (Machine Learning). But for causal inference, when we have A LOT of 
potential confounders we can first use LASSO to reduce the dimensionality and then an OLS for the remaining set of control variables. (BEWARE: standardise all variables before LASSO)

## Regression extensions: use it for imputation!

One way of making use of models that is less sensitive to the specification of a single coefficient is to use the model for imputation.

* Use the model(s) to predict the potential outcomes, and then calculate the difference of interest

* For inference, use the bootstrap

In epidemiology, this is known as g-computation ("g" stands for "generalized")

This works well, above and beyond what looking at a single coefficient would give you

Even more, this can be paired with flexible machine learning approaches (e.g. LASSO), going beyond linear regression models (see augmented methods)

# Modeling the treatment assignment {background-color="#E9004C"}

## Matching

For each treated unit $i$ with covariates $X_i$, we will estimate $\tau_i = Y^T_{i} - Y^C_{i}$

. . .

For treated units, we immediately have $Y^T$. But where do we get $Y^C$ from?

* **Matching**: borrow the missing potential outcomes from control units with (nearly) the same $X_i$ values

The estimator is then:

$$
\hat{\tau}_{ATT} = \frac{1}{N_t} \sum_{D=1}(Y_i - Y_{j(i)})
$$

Where $Y_{j(i)}$ is the outcome of unit $j$, which is closest to $i$ in terms of their covariates

. . .

In the simples case, $j$ is a single unit, without replacement. In more complicated versions, it can be an (weighted) average of units that are reused several times

. . .

:::{.callout-warning}
## But beware of the curse of dimensionality!
:::

## Matching: pros and cons

Pros:

* Does not rely on linearity or other restrictive assumptions

* Design-based intuition

* Flexible to get different estimands (ATE, ATT, ATC)

* Reduces extrapolation 

* Robust to model misspecification

* Clear diagnostics on balance and overlap

Cons:

* Many different ways to do it, lots of decisions to be made

* Better for discrete (e.g. binary) treatments

* Curse of dimensionality

* Doesn't work well in longitudinal settings with time varying covariates

* Throws away data

## Matching: choices, choices

* Select variables to match on (confounders that would help block backdoors, avoid mediators! The same as regression)

* Find a way to measure distance between matched treated and control cases

  * [Exact matching]{style="color:red"}: a treated unit is matched with control with exact same values on confounders
  
  * [Distance matching]{style="color:red"}: find matches that are not too distant based on a distance metric
  (e.g. Euclidean Distance or Mahalanobis distance--similar to ED with standardised units); decide on a *caliper/bandwidth* 


* One-to-one or one-to-many matching?

* How to break ties? When two exact control matches for a treatment?

* If one-to-many matches, do we weight better matches more? If so how?

* Matching with or without replacement? The default is the former

Once you decide all those (!) checking balance between treatment and control and estimating ATE, ATT, or ATC are very easy!

## Weighting 

The idea of weighting comes from survey research: how do we get a representative sample?

It is very similar to matching

. . .

* Instead of strata-specific effects that are then reweighted by $X$, make $X$ look similar across groups and then take a simple average!

. . .

Recall that the difference-in-means can be viewed as:

$$
\sum_x E[Y_i | D=1, X]\color{red}{P(X|D=1)} - \sum_x E[Y_i | D=0, X]\color{red}{P(X|D=0)}
$$

[How to solve the discrepancy in the weights?]{style="color:red"}

. . .

We want the weights of the diff-in-means to be $P(X)$ for everyone, so we can re-weight by $\frac{P(D_i)}{P(D_i|X_i)}$ (but, note that this requires a model for $P(D_i|X_i)$!)

## Weighting: pros and cons

Pros:

* Uses all data

* Conceptually clean

* Can work with post-treatment variables (under sequential ignorability)

* Handles many covariates easily

Cons:

* Extreme weights can mess things up

* High variance 

* Sensitive to selection modeling choices 

* Not intuitive

* Not familiar

## How to weight: propensity scores

*(Stabilized or trimmed) propensity score weights* can be used for weighting. Other names for the same object are *inverse probability of the treatment weighting* or simply *inverse probability weighting* (IPW)

Those weights require estimating a model for the treatment assignment $P(D_i|X_i)$. In other words, they require we fit a [*propensity score*]{style="color:blue"} model, $P(D_i=1|X_i) = e(X_i)$ (or $\pi(X_i)$)

. . .

Using propensity score for weighting is based on a simple but powerful result. If:

$$
\{Y_1,Y_0\} \indep D_i | X_i
$$
Then,

$$
\{Y_1,Y_0\} \indep D_i | e(X_i)
$$

. . .

The propensity score is a [*balancing score*]{style="color:green"}, that will achieve balance in the variables used to estimate the propensity score, [*in expectation*]{style="color:red"}

NB: Propensity score *matching* an old practice is not advised anymore, but PS *weighting* is (currently) safe

## Propensity score weights

For the ATE, the corresponding IPWs are:

$$
w_i = \frac{D_i}{e(X_i)} + \frac{1-D_i}{1-e(X_i)}
$$

. . .  

* What would this weights do for the treated units? And for the controls?

With these weights, IPW estimator is simply:


$$
\widehat{\mathrm{ATE}}_{\mathrm{IPW}}
=
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n
\left(
\frac{D_i Y_i}{\hat e(X_i)}
-
\frac{(1-D_i) Y_i}{1-\hat e(X_i)}
\right)
= 
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n
(Y_i w_i)
$$



* How would you modify these weights to target ATT or ATC?

**Hint**: multiply by $e(X_i)$ for ATT and by $1 - e(X_i)$ for ATC

## Stabilised and trimmed weights

When weights in denominator very small, it can blow up and unstabilise the estimator.

**Solution 1**: *stabilised weights*

For the ATE, the corresponding stabilised IPWs are:

$$
sw_i = \frac{e(X) D_i}{e(X_i)} + \frac{(1-e(X))(1-D_i)}{1-e(X_i)}
$$
where $e(X) = P(Y=1)$, marginal probability of treatment (sample proportion). 

For ATT: $sw_i = 1$ for treated units and $sw_i = \frac{e(X_i)}{1-e(X_i)}$ for coontrol units

**Solution 2**: Cap the weights at a min and max value (*trimmed weights*)

**Solution 3**: Drop cases with extreme values (*trimmed cases*)

**Solution 4**: mix solutions 1-3

Note when trimming is used, interpretation of ATT/ATE changes slightly.

## How to weight with a different scale: entropy balancing (calibration weights)

When using propensity score weights, we want to achieve is balance on covariates. So we would:

1) estimate a model for $e(X_i)$; 

2) invert and and reweight sample; 

3) check balance; 

4) re-estimate propensity score if necessary.

. . .

Is that the only way?


[*Entropy balancing*]{style="color:red"} or more generally [*calibration/optimisation*]{style="color:red"} weights *bypass* these steps, and directly find weights that exactly (up to a tolerance level) "balance" (moments of) the covariates

If feasible, this will give you balance [*in the sample*]{style="color:green"}

Luckily, we don't need to do this manually, R can do it for us

## Balance and overlap

Once matching or weigthing is done, one can/should check [*balance*]{style="color:red"} in X variables by comparing pre- and post- matching and weighting distributions of variables. There should not be systematic differences between the treatment and control group after matching/weighting. 

[*Overlap or common support*]{style="color:red"} can/should be checked too. There must be substantial
overlap between treatment and control groups re matching variables. This can be checked on covariates or
propensity scores. 

If common support is not good: [*trim*]{style="color:red"} (drop cases without common support)

. . .

NB: balance and overlap issues are less transparent in regression.

## Summary for matching and weighting

Matching and weighting share many common ideas

Most importantly, they all allow for some diagnostics *before* conducting the outcome analysis: balance testing

Checking balance does not require looking at the outcome, in fact one doesn't look at the outcome at all
during finding matches or weights

This can provide a guidance on the credibility of the results to come 

. . . 

* This is what Rubin meant by "design triumphs analysis"

. . . 

But be careful of overly relying on balance checking! (And use best practices, like equivalence testing)

Also, beware of residual imbalance! Modeling the outcome can come handy, as we will see next



# Augmented estimators {background-color="#E9004C"}

## Augmented IPW 

Can we get the best of both (regression on the one hand and weighting on the other) worlds? Yes, we can!

Combine balancing (weighting) with outcome modeling (regression) in a single estimator: augmented IPW

$$
\hat{\tau}_{AIPW} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \Big( \hat{\mu}(1,X_i) - \hat{\mu}(0,X_i)
+ \frac{D_i}{\hat{e}(X_i)}(Y_i - \hat{\mu}(1,X_i)) - \frac{1-D_i}{1-\hat{e}(X_i)}(Y_i - \hat{\mu}(0,X_i)) \Big)
$$
This has the property of **doubly robustness** (DR): the model with be consistent for the treatment effect if either 

1) the outcome model or, 

2) the treatment model, are well specified

. . .

## Important
The augmented estimator requires the same unconfoundedness assumption! No free lunch

## What about machine learning?

There are different ways of using machine learning for estimation

* Flexible model of the outcome + imputation

* Flexible model of the treatment + weighting

* Or combibine both: **Double/debiased ML**

*Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML): similar to doubly robust IPW estimator but the outcome and selection are predicted using ML

* DML works in three steps:

1. Predict outcome $Y$ with ML using covariates (e.g. LASSO/forest ...) and obtain residuals $Y-\widehat{Y}$

2. Predict treatment $D$ with ML using covariates (e.g. LASSO/forest ...) and obtain residuals $D-\widehat{D}$

3. Regress ($Y-\widehat{Y}$) on ($D-\widehat{D}$) for the doubly robust DML estimate


## Wrap up

* We looked at four ways of closing backdoors in simple confounding models
  1. Regression
  2. Matching
  3. Weighting
  4. Augmented estimators (doubly robust IPW and double/debiased machine learning)

* What should we do in practice?

Well, no approach is superior. Use a combination of approaches.

* Regression is easy so do it even as robustness check.

* If treatment is binary, IPW or entropy balancing weighting is probably advisable vis-a-vis matching, for the latter has many researcher degrees of freedom.

* Try augmented estimators and double ML when you have **many (!)** confounders, interactions, or nonlinearities AND **large** dataset.

Hands-on-exercises of this week treats these.

## Remember: Regression, matching, weighting, doubly robust estimation, double machine learning or however fancy sounding method of selection on observables are NOT identification strategies!

Identification comes from design, model, and extra-statistical assumptions, not from the estimator!
